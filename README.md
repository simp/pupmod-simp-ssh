## This is a SIMP module
This module is a component of the [System Integrity Management Platform](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/SIMP), a compliance-management framework built on Puppet.

If you find any issues, they can be submitted to our [JIRA](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/).

## Work in Progress

Please excuse us as we transition this code into the public domain.


## Ciphers

At the time of this build, the strongest ciphers for use in ssh are:
*        aes128-gcm@openssh.com
*        aes256-gcm@openssh.com

Other allowable ciphers that can be included during install are:
*        aes128-cbc
*        aes192-cbc
*        aes256-cbc

### Server

The ciphers configured for use with the ssh server can be set to include all allowable ciphers or to include only the strongest ciphers, by default it is set to install all allowable ciphers.  Initially only the strongest ciphers were installed but in order to allow users to ssh into the server without updating the code a change was made.  (SIMP-560).  A setting was created to make the ciphers configurable. The setting is  **ssh::server::use_strong_ciphers_only**.  This parameter is defaulted to false and it will install all the allowable ciphers during the initial simp config.  You can change this at any time after the install by simply editing the simp_def.yaml file and adding a line with ssh::server::use_strong_ciphers_only : true .  This will change the setting for all servers.  You can set per server if you wish,  read more about how hiera works to do this.

###Client

The ciphers configured for the ssh client are set to only the strongest ciphers.  In order to connect to a system that does not have these ciphers but uses the older ciphers you should use the command line option, 'ssh -c'.  See the man pages for further information.
